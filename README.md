# Project 1 : Write A Data Science Blog Post.
Project Submission : Data Science at Udacity.



## Installations.
  This project was written on Anaconda with Jupyter application by Python version 3.9.5. To check Python by `python --version`. 
I use the library for support visualization using `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` and `sklearn`.
You can install the library as a terminal on the iOS system as follows:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install collection
```



## Project Motivation.
  This project is a visualization by using the data of [Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) 
by collecting information from users which we can use the data from Stack Overflow to be analyzed for use in business.

  Stack Overflow demonstrates the importance of data. It can be seen that data is collected from a wide variety of populations. Most of which are used in computer language. It is undeniable that applications are part of the daily life of work.

  In order to visualize more, we remember to start learning by visualization. As well as to compare the data in the prediction.


## File Description.
This project consists of the following:
* survey_results_public.csv
* survey_results_schema.csv
* README.md
* The Result of Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017.ipynb



## How To Interact With Your Project.

  I learned and understood the data. From learning at Udacity and using it to find answers as follows:

1. Viewing the mean of integer and decimal numeric data.
2. Visualization of data by barh and bar graph.
4. Separation of duplicate data for the popularity of the survey.
5. Differentiating between positive and negative information.
6. Comparison of data from prediction.

  If you are looking to learn the basics of data analysis. I hope this article will be useful to you.
